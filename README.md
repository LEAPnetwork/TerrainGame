# TerrainGame
(3D)
The scope of this game is to allow students to get familiar with the Terrain Editor available in Unity.
Rather than a complete game, the product is in this case a very polished demo scene with simple (but many) assets. 

Students should be provided with a set of prefabs ready to use that can allow them to make a game in which they can have:
- character control
- enemies (patrolling and chasing the player)
- jumping platforms
- portals
- multiple character options
- decoration props
- simple sound fx for actions

Optionally, the playable character may need to collect items in the game or shoot at enemies, or the like.
